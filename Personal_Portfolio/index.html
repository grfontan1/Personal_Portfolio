            <p>Hi, I'm Giovanni Fontanesi and I am a begginer programmer, currently focusing on Web Development. I consider myself a perpetual student, and love to learn new things. I am particulary interested in science, technology, economics and enginnering. 
            I am also the founder of a Bitcoin mining company, as Bitcoin is a huge passion of mine.
            </p>
            <p>Before I got into Bitcoin, I was a research assistant, in a radiobiology lab, conducting Alzheimer's research on mice. There, we were able to publish papers on the effects of Low Dose Brain Irradiation on Amyloid-B plaques. Prior to this research, I was a student researcher, at my university, conducting copulation studies in the evolutionary pyschology lab.</p>
            <p>In my free time I enjoy reading, gardening, and fornite. My book interests include science fiction, philosophy, and biology/psychology. My gardening is mostly growing peppers. As for fortnite, you dont want to catch me on the sticks. </p>

        <h1 class='projects'>Projects</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, I do not have any finished projects, as I have just started my journey in programming. I have a few programs finished, but they are just simple things, like a random quote generator.</p>
